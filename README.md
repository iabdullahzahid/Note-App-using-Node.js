# Note-App-using-Node.js
My first app using Node.js with basic features like adding note, removing note, listing notes, and reading a note. The purpose was to get started with Node.js and get hand on experience. In this app i got hand on expereience on different  modules like (core module : fs) (npm modules like yargs, chalk, and  nodemon) and (modules created by my self and exporting them).
Please make sure to initialalize npm so that npm module directory could be loaded so all the dependecies are loaded.
type :  npm install
